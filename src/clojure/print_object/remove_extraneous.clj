;; The Clojure default for printing objects is noisy.

(Object.)

;; The syntax is `#object[CLASS-NAME HASH toString())]`
;; and as you can see, the toString of an Object is `CLASS-NAME@HASH`.
;; For most objects this becomes quite a long string.

;; Functions are printed as objects

(fn [x] x)

;; It's quite easy to miss the fact that it is a function as we are looking for a tiny little `fn` in a sea of text.
;; If, like me, you are fond of the [odd lambda calculus excursion](/code_interview/beating/with_stupid_stuff/z_combinator_gambit.html),
;; things get even more hectic.

((fn [x] (fn [v] ((x x) v))) (fn [y] y))

;; Yikes! what an eyesore.
;; This is not an academic issue specific to lambda calculus.
;; Any function created from inside a function is helpfully identifiable through the `fn$fn` nesting.
;; We create these quite regularly, and they are often printed in stack traces.
;; I'm sure you have seen them when you map an inline function across a seq, and there is a bug in the anonymous function.

       (vec (take 4 (.getStackTrace ex)))))

;; See that part `caesar_cipher$add2`?
;; That is **very** useful information.
;; It tells us that the exception was inside `add2`, which is inside `caesar-cipher`.
;; The stack trace doesn't print functions as objects,
;; but it illustrates that the thing that we care about is that they are a function,
;; what their name is, and whether they were created from inside another function.

;; Let's return to printing a function as an object.
;; An easy improvement is to demunge from Java names to Clojure names.
;; Demunging converts `_` to `-` and `$` to `/`, and munged characters like `+` which is `PLUS` in Java.

;; Much nicer.
;; I can actually read that!
;; I'm not particularly fond of the long namespace shown as the name is either defined in this namespace,
;; referred, or part of `clojure.core`.
;; The multiple slashes form invalid symbols which annoy me;
;; I prefer using `/` only for `namespace/name` separation and `$` as the name level delimiter:
;; `my.namespace/my$nested$name`.

;; This is really all I care to know about when printing objects and functions,
